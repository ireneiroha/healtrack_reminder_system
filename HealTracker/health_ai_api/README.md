##Flask Career API for Java Integration
This repository provides a standalone Flask service that wraps career advice functionality, enabling seamless integration with Java backends via HTTP.
 Features

Exposes a /health endpoint to provide career advice based on user input.
Configurable with Hugging Face API for enhanced functionality.
Lightweight and easy to integrate with Java Spring Boot applications.
Optional health check endpoint for service monitoring.

##Setup Instructions
1. Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
pip for installing dependencies
A Hugging Face API token (sign up at Hugging Face to get one)

2. Configure Environment

Navigate to the project directory:cd health_ai_api


Copy the example environment file:cp .env.example .env


Edit .env and add your Hugging Face API token:HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=hf_your_token_here



##Install Dependencies and Run

Install required Python packages:pip install -r requirements.txt


Start the Flask server:python health_ai_api/ai_endpoint.py


The server will be available at http://localhost:5000/.

 Using with Java Spring Boot
You can integrate this API with a Java Spring Boot application using either WebClient or RestTemplate.
Example with WebClient
WebClient client = WebClient.create("http://localhost:5000");
String advice = client.post()
    .uri("/health")
    .bodyValue(Map.of("user_input", "i have a slight headache?"))
    .retrieve()
    .bodyToMono(JsonNode.class)
    .map(json -> json.get("advice").asText())
    .block();

Example with RestTemplate
RestTemplate rest = new RestTemplate();
JsonNode resp = rest.postForObject(
    "http://localhost:5000/health",
    Map.of("user_input", "how do i get rid of my acne"),
    JsonNode.class
);
String advice = resp.get("advice").asText();

 Health Check (Optional)
To ensure the service is running, you can add a health check endpoint in app.py:
@app.get("/health")
def health():
    return {"status": "ok"}

Test it by sending a GET request to http://localhost:5000/health.

# Example environment variables

üîç Notes

Ensure the Flask server is running before making requests from your Java application.
The /career endpoint expects a JSON payload with a user_input field containing the career-related query.
For production, consider securing the API with authentication and running it behind a reverse proxy like Nginx.
